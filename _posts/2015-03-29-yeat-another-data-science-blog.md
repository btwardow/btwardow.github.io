It's been a while since I created this blog project on GitHub and made a first commit to repository. 
And it's even been longer since I started thinking about writing by own blog. But, You know... everybody got their day to day duties.
Work, PhD studies, climbing and coding own ideas/challenges - can absorb by time fully. 

_So why why bother writing something that no one will ever read?_

There are plethora of a IT blogs over the Internet. Especially about data science, data analysis and machine learning. I have my favorites ones subscribed in a RSS reader to keep up-to date with the interesting news. Is it worth write another one? If so, should I write only about my studies - recommender systems and data personalization? Can I really share something interesting? 

Till the last Friday I would answer for all of this questions simply - **NO**. But after this weekend something has changed. 
I got cold and spent most of my time attached to the bed. Of course notebook was my companion. Despite reading a lots of useless news and articles, I managed to work on my tasks for Recsys Challenge and Kaggle. While coding and searching information over the Internet, I just realized that most of my browser tabs showing research papers and data scientist blogs. Yes, blog posts about machine learning and data analysis! And the subject, let's say, was pretty narrow. Thus, finding any information was possible due to the fact that someone, somewhere decided to write it on blog!. Maybe even for selfish motives and only to promote itself. But still, the information on this sites helped me solved the problem and save lots of my own time. 

So, here I am. In front of Vim with a Sunday afternoon coffee hoping someone will find here something useful in near feature :-)
