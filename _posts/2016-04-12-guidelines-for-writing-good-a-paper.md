I've just finished writing a submission for a one of machine learning conferences.
It was a short-paper, so You may say it's not a big deal. But for me, it was a
lot of work. On 4 pages I've placed only results for my, new approach and described
only what's crucial for the experiments. But before that, I had to reproduce all work of
others I based my research. And this was not the easiest part.

But back to writing a good paper. First, lets define what is good paper? I'm not
talking about style, format, math conventions, etc. But about the merit of it -
a contribution that it makes to scientific world. And most of all, how not to
participate in a *Cargo Cult Science*. What is it? Read the [whole
speech](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf) given
by Richard Feynman in 1974. You will not regret this. It is still so up to
date.

If we decided not to *fool ourself*, we can continue and start writing. As for
me vim+latex+makefile works best as an environment for scientific papers. No
fancy GUI, no distraction, just productivity. I do not have to describes those
great tools and there are lots of help over the Internet. 

Then You will find some subtle aspect that You are not sure how to write or
present in Your work. It's probably more true if You are not writing in Your native
language. I found lots of useful information in below sites:

[Write the paper first](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/write-the-paper-first.html)

[Jordan Boyd-Graber: Style](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jbg/static/style.html)

[Some advice on writing well for NLP](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/writing_advice.html)

[English Communication for Scientists](http://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/english-communication-for-scientists-14053993/contents)


So, after all, even writing short-paper we can learn a lot! Moreover, we can
find out that the same problems in a science least for decades and are still so
common.
